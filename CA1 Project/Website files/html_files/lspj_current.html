			<h2>Starting Polytechnic</h2>
			<p>I entered Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Infocomm and Security Management (DISM) course through the Early Admission Exercise (EAE), meeting many friendly and passionate people determined to do well. However, the overall experience of Poly is much different from Secondary School. The first being the schedule, as every day begins and ends at a different time. Therefore, an immense level of self-discipline is required to force myself to school, especially since I live one hour away from school. Another thing is the lesson notes; no longer do we use pen and paper; everything is now digital, in PowerPoint slides or word documents. Thus, making students much more susceptible to distractions and enabling notes to be taken down faster, such that lessons can go more quickly.</p>

			<h2>My CCAs</h2>
			<p>Although I am interested in many different activities, I wanted to focus on video editing and helping the community. Hence I decided to join Singapore Poly's videography club and School of Computing Ambassadors (SOCA).</p>
			<ul> <!-- Unordered list -->
				<li>I chose the videography club to further developing my video editing abilities as my interest. Additionally, to learn camera tricks and the filming process on top of my current knowledge in post-production.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, I also joined SOCA to aid in future SOC events to enable fun and engaging events for my fellow SOC peers. Also, I wanted to meet new and exciting people who share similar pursuits.</li>

			<h2>Studies and Workload</h2>
			<p>The teaching system in Poly is very different from Secondary School, as everything is more self-directed. Especially in regards to your learning schedule and the content learnt. A segment of Poly's grades comes from weekly quizzes that begin to overwhelm students when practically every module has a quiz. Thus, requiring a new sense of responsibility to be on top of all the happenings in your modules. Also, some subjects like Math, do not actually teach during lessons. Instead, the content from these lessons comes from weekly released videos that go through what is taught. As such, it is vital to remain consistent and on top of your schedule.</p>

			<p>In addition, a large percentage of marks come from projects, whether it be group projects or individual projects (like this website!). These projects are impossible to complete in a short span of 1 to 2 days; thus, they require continuous effort to complete them within the deadline. Also, when it comes to group projects, it is critical to have good communication skills and to be proactive.  Having to work with multiple people may become troublesome as everyone has different schedules and habits. For example, some may sleep early, some late, some wake up early, and some wake up late. Finding a standard time on top of these life habits and within everybody's schedule has proven quite an issue for me. But it is essential to be open-minded and help out your group members because you are a part of the team in the end.</p>
