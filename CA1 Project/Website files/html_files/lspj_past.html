			<h2>Where I studied</h2>
			<p>I studied at St. Patrick's Secondary School from 2017 to 2020, taking double science (Chemistry and Physics) and Computing. St Patrick's School was an all-boys school, so the school had a strong sense of brotherhood. Even though the whole class may not have been very bonded, we all were willing to lend a hand to help each other out. In addition, the school was proficient in equipping us for our O'Levels while enabling us to enjoy our carefree Secondary School lives. Overall, the teachers were kind and efficient, and classes were a blast! Studying there was indeed a unique experience you will not find at other schools!</p>

			<h2>My Commitments</h2>
			<p>My school provided me with ample leadership opportunities, be it in class or through CCAs. As a result, I managed to use my array of skills to contribute to many of these projects.</p>

				<li>Led my class in another VIA project in 2019 centred around raising awareness about animal abuse in Singapore.</li>
				<li>I was also given the President for the Media and Resource Library role, guiding my fellow peers and juniors in an assorted range of competitions in essay writing, videography, and photography.</li>
				<li>Lastly, I aided in several school and class events as a video editor, editing videos for Teachers' Day and National Day. </li>

			<h2>Coding Experiences</h2>
			<p>Studying computing for O'Levels in Secondary School and having an incredibly supportive teacher had given me an abundance of experience in coding and computing. I took part in many competitions, workshops and completed many online courses in efforts to upskill myself.</p>
			<ul> <!-- Unordered list -->
				<li>I began coding from my computing lessons in Secondary 3, learning Python</li>
				<li>Then, I took up several online courses to learn HTML, CSS and JS to make my portfolio website.</li>
				<li>I also completed cybersecurity courses like the Singtel Cyber Xperience.</li>
