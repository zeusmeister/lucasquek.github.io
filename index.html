          <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>My father, being in the IT sector, taught me from young about the basics of technology, about websites and networking. Soon after, along with my interest in gaming,
            he helped me in creating servers for games that I loved to play, TF2 and CSGO. The TF2 server was extremely popular in Asia and was top 10 in Singapore for a period of time. Later, we experienced a DDOS attack on our servers which were hosted at home, bringing down our home internet. Causing us to shut down our servers permanently.
            </p>
            <p>My prior experience with hosting servers peaked my interest in technology and the depths of it. I started learning to code with python in Secondary 2, when I learnt that my school offered a computing subject and was determined to enter it. I started taking the subject in Secondary 3 and consistently scored A1s for it. I later started to branch out to different languages and new skills
